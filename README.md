The ODM-to-i2b2 project is a fork with added functionality of the REDCap-to-i2b2 project:
https://community.i2b2.org/wiki/display/ODM2i2b2/Home

This tools allows you to convert an ODM file to tabular data files that are ready to import in an i2b2-like system like
tranSMART. The 'OpenClinica to tranSMART' conversion, which exports tabular text files, build on the same automatically
generated Java sources as the 'RedCap to i2b2' conversion, which exports to a database:

Status at release 3.0 (2015 June 12): 3 tabular files are produced for each study: a clinical data file (with the data),
a columns file (with metadata about each column in the clinical data file) and a wordmap file (with the full word values
that come in place of the numerical codes in the clinical data). This conversion runs without errors for a wide
variety of tested ODM exports from OpenClinica. It also deals appropriately with repeating elements,
like events and item groups.
